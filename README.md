Canvas is an iOS library that creates an area on the screen where the user can draw lines and shapes, style drawings by adding different types of brushes, and work with multiple layers. It provides an easy way to add on-screen drawing to any iOS app.

## Features
- **Canvas**: A simple UIView with a clear background.
- **CanvasTools**: Draw using different shapes (pen, eraser, line, rectangle, rectangleFill, ellipse, ellipseFill)
- **CanvasLayers**: Create multiple drawing layers that can be moved, swapped, hidden, locked, and more.
- **Brushes**: Create and use different brushes to style drawings on the canvas.
- **Protocols**: Keep track of when the user starts drawing, is drawing, and finishes drawing by using the CanvasProtocol.
- **Import/Export**: Import multiple UIImages as CanvasLayers, then export your canvas drawing as a UIImage.
- **Undo/Redo**: Support for undo and redo of drawings.

## Installation

Canvas is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
